PayPay App
PayPay aims to solve the unnecessary use of voucher tickets in events by providing an in-app menu and payment platform for consumers to use. PayPay also provides a an automated QR generators to consumers for vendors to verify the specific order and set whether the order has been claimed or not. Claimed orders act as a safety for vendors as consumers will not be able to use the same QR code twice as it will be rendered invalid once the vendor has clicked the claim button.
